Kelley Kelley
CSCI 5229 Fall 2021

Program for different projection/camera types
One orthogonal, one perspective, one first person

Time Spent: um...2 hours...idk, I just took hw3 and added the projections
had some extra time so added bounds so you can't walk outside the area or in the fence

Key Bindings:
Arrow keys: move display around
Pageup/Pagedwn: zoom in/out
Space: rerandomize everything
p: change perspective
f/F: change FOV
WASD: move around in first person
EQ: rotate in first person
