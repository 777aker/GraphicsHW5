hw5: Light

Kelley Kelley
CSCI 5229 Fall 2021

Program for lighting, builds upon
HW4 and uses a lot from it
Really actually just added lighting
to HW4
The icosahedrons are kind of copied from ex13
but also not because I wanted color to work
a certain way which means I kind of had to deconstruct it a little
